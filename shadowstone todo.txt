make text more readable
    like icons underneath attack, magic, health
    use a better font
update to use slick 1.0.2
separate "minion attack" resolver from the "ordering attack" part
    e.g. allow an effect that forces minions to attack something, without adding to their attacks per turn
add a really cool claw slashing attack animation :D
make game fullscreen and fix flickering problem from rendering text
UnicodeFont deprecated? use AngelCodeFonts
Figure out why the game is eating cpu and gpu
relpos lol
formalize basic effects? createBasicEffect()
priority
drain/lifesteal
stealth
shield
