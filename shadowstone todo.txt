Fix case where AI could traverse a cycle in the decision tree (i.e. goes from state A -> B -> A)
	crashes because the deeper instance modifies the bsn while the top instance is looping thru it
when sampling, make some actions have more weight (like unleashing and attacking face)
	attacking with larger attack minions should have more weight
	also make the end turn action have like no weight at all
assign a advantage value to effects (like brambles)

Unforce the Effect(string) constructor, instead allow Effect() constructor?
unforce every uielement constructor taking in a ui as a parameter
targeting serverside verification
